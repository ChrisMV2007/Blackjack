# Blackjack

## DESCRIPTION
A text based game built in python; I developed a text-based blackjack in python around a year ago so I decided to redevelop it to 1) learn how github works and 2) see what optimizations I can make from my atrocious first attempt. I used to have a massive programmer ego (despite being a terrible programmer) and used complicated syntax to make myself feel smart, so this time I really emphasized readability. Of course the only pre requisite here is just knowing the rules of blackjack.

## BLACKJACK RULES (partially from bicyclecards.com, partially from Alyssa May Zamora):
-Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
-It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its numeric value.
-Before the deal begins, each player places a bet and recives 2 cards.
-To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
-If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
-If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
-Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. 
-To Double Down is to double your bet, and if you double down you only get 1 more card.
-When you have 2 of the same card you can split your hand into two hands, and you can double your split hands.
-You can only split on your first 'move', before any additional cards are dealt.
-You can only double on your first move, or the first move of a hand created by a split.
-You will recieve one additional card on each split hand, and you cannot draw more.
-Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
After looking it up I realized that blackjack is traditionally played with 6-8 decks, so note that this game is played not with one continuous deck with 1 of each card but a new card is instantiated whenever a new one is necessitated (call me lazy but this just makes more sense lol).
