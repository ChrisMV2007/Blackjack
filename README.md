# Blackjack
A text based game built in python; I developed a text-based blackjack in python around a year ago so I decided to redevelop it to 1) learn how github works and 2) see what optimizations I can make from my atrocious first attempt.

Of course the only pre requisite here is just knowing the rules of blackjack.
BLACKJACK RULES (partially from bicyclecards.com, partially from Alyssa May Zamora):
-Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
-It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its numeric value.
-Before the deal begins, each player places a bet and recives 2 cards.
-To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
-If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
-If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
-Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. 
-To Double Down is to double your bet, and if you double down you only get 1 more card
-When you have 2 of the same card you can split your hand into two hands, and you can double your split hands
-You can only split on your first 'move', before any additional cards are dealt
-You can only double on your first move, or the first move of a hand created by a split
-Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
